// Sort the vector given from least to greatest. Created a for loop to go through each value in the vector and check how many times each value appears (frequency). This frequency value is pushed back into a vector named compare every time the next value of the given vector is different from its previous number. A vector of all frequencies for each value in the given vector is created. Then, this vector is ordered from least to greatest and the largest frequency is found as it is the last value in the vector. This value is then found in the unsorted copy of the 'compare' vector. A for loop is created to find the location of the largest frequency value. Then, in the 'compare' vector all of the frequencies are summed up until that frequency value to then find the location of the most frequent value in the given vector.
